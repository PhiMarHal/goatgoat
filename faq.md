<h3>When leveraging, do IMX rewards compound?</h3>

IMX rewards are claimed manually at your convenience. They don't compound.

<h3>[Moonriver] Do MOVR rewards compound?</h3>

MOVR rewards can be claimed manually just like IMX rewards.
MOVR rewards are also claimed automatically with any action tied to your LP (leverage, deleverage, withdraw, deposit).

The network is likely congested.
On blockchains, transactions work in order.
This means you must find the first transaction that got stuck, then speed it up.
