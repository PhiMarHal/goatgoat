<h3>When leveraging, do IMX rewards compound?</h3>

IMX rewards are claimed manually at your convenience. They don't compound.

<br>
<h3>[Moonriver] Do MOVR rewards compound?</h3>

MOVR rewards can be claimed manually just like IMX rewards.

MOVR rewards are also claimed automatically with any action tied to your LP (leverage, deleverage, withdraw, deposit).

<h3>[Polygon] I'm trying to withdraw, but my transactions won't go through. I have several queued transactions</h3>

The network is likely congested.

On blockchains, transactions work in order.

This means you must find the first transaction that got stuck, then speed it up.

Use a tool like Owlracle to choose your gas price: https://owlracle.info/poly

<h3>[Polygon] I'm having issues with getting Polygon to load correctly. Other networks are fine.</h3>

Changing the default RPC may help. polygon-rpc.com is a good one.

To change your RPC, go to Metamask -> Settings -> Networks. Pick Matic.

Then, replace "New RPC URL" with https://polygon-rpc.com

<br>
<h3>Are there any fees on deposits?</h3>

There are no fees on deposits or withdrawals.

<br>
<h3>Are there any fees on leveraging?</h3>

On Ethereum, Polygon and Arbitrum, there is a 0.1% upfront fee on leveraging.

This fee is applied per degree of leverage.

If you enter a position with 4x leverage, you will pay 0.1% * (4 - 1) = 0.3% of your capital upfront.

Avalanche and Moonriver have no upfront fee on leveraging.

There are no fees on deleveraging anywhere.

<br>
<h3>Can I use Impermax for my LPs without leveraging?</h3>

Yes! If you deposit LPs without leveraging, Impermax acts as an autocompounder.
